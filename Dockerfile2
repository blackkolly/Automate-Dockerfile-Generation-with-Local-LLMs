```Dockerfile
# Use an official lightweight Python runtime as a parent image (Alpine for smaller footprint)
FROM python:3.9-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the requirements file first and install dependencies if any were added later on, this is optional since no specific dependency installation was needed as per requirement 2 but included for completeness of best practices.
COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy only the necessary files (e.g., just your application code) to the container's working directory
COPY main.py /app/main.py

# Run python app.py when the container launches, using CMD instruction for simplicity and clarity in this example which can be replaced with ENTRYPOINT if needed (e.g., entrypoint scripts)
CMD ["python", "./main.py"]

# Expose port 5000 to allow access from outside the container, assuming it's a web application that listens on this port; adjust as necessary for your app type and needs
EXPOSE 5000
